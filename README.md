## üèõÔ∏è System Architecture

The application follows a standard 3-tier architecture, separating the client-side, server-side, and database concerns for scalability and maintainability.

* **Frontend (Vercel)**: A responsive React single-page application that provides the user interface.
* **Backend (Render)**: A RESTful API built with Node.js and Express that handles all business logic, user authentication, and data processing.
* **Database (Render)**: A PostgreSQL database that stores all user, employee, and leave request data.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

* Node.js (v18 or later)
* npm
* A local PostgreSQL instance

### Local Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/Sankalpa-01/Leave-Management.git](https://github.com/Sankalpa-01/Leave-Management.git)
    cd Leave-Management
    ```

2.  **Backend Setup:**
    * Navigate to the backend directory:
        ```sh
        cd backend
        ```
    * Install NPM packages:
        ```sh
        npm install
        ```
    * Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory and add the following variables. Replace the values with your local database credentials.
        ```env
        # .env.example
        PORT=5000
        DATABASE_URL="postgres://YOUR_DB_USER:YOUR_DB_PASSWORD@localhost:5432/YOUR_DB_NAME"
        JWT_SECRET="YOUR_SUPER_SECRET_JWT_KEY"
        FRONTEND_URL="http://localhost:5173"
        ```
    * Start the backend server:
        ```sh
        npm run dev
        ```

3.  **Frontend Setup:**
    * Navigate to the frontend directory from the root folder:
        ```sh
        cd frontend
        ```
    * Install NPM packages:
        ```sh
        npm install
        ```
    * Create a `.env` file in the `frontend` directory and add the following variable:
        ```env
        # .env.example
        VITE_API_BASE_URL="http://localhost:5000/api"
        ```
    * Start the frontend development server:
        ```sh
        npm run dev
        ```

The application should now be running locally, with the frontend at `http://localhost:5173` and the backend at `http://localhost:5000`.

## üîÆ Potential Improvements

* **Email Notifications**: Integrate a service like Nodemailer to send email alerts on leave application and status changes.
* **Manager Role**: Introduce a "Manager" role who can approve leaves for their direct reports.
* **Company Calendar**: Add a shared calendar view to visualize who is on leave to help with team planning.
* **Leave Types**: Differentiate between leave types (e.g., Sick, Vacation, Unpaid) with separate balances.
* **File Attachments**: Allow employees to attach documents (e.g., doctor's notes) to their leave requests.
